init
remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/Hello-World.git -- to assign a value to the origin master remote property. 

git remote -v (show the remotes you have stored to be used)
git fetch (origin) (Pull everything you don't have from that repository, branches and all, w/o merging)
pull (origin) (Pull everything & merge it into your work)
status
reset
clone (if you clone, it sets that respository as origin, so fetch and pull will default use it.)
diff (origin/master or --cached or HEAD) (show all changes that took place since last commit)
branch "name" (create branch)
checkout "name" (switch to branch)
To push changes to github:
add (-A for all, -u for modified and deleted w/o new, . for new and modified, w/o deleted)
commit -m "Changes here"
push (origin master)       

if changes have been made to both local and remote, and you just want to grab the remote branch data
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master

if you KNOW your local contains the correct data and you did your work without pulling (be careful... this should mean you checked
the changes with diff and incorporated them locally, but didn't actually pull them.. be careful)
git push origin master -f
